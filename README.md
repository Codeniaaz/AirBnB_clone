The `cmd` module in Python stands for "Command-Line Interface (CLI) Command Processor". It provides a framework for building simple command-line interpreters. With `cmd`, you can easily create custom command-line interfaces for your Python programs. It allows you to define commands, handle user input, and execute actions based on those commands. This module is particularly useful for creating interactive command-line programs with features like autocompletion, help messages, and command history.
