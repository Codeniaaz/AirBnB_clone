HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It provides the structure and content of a webpage through a system of tags and elements. HTML tags define different parts of the webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. By arranging these tags in a specific way, developers can create a structured layout for their content.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language that complements HTML by controlling the presentation and layout of web pages. With CSS, developers can specify various style properties like colors, fonts, margins, padding, and positioning for HTML elements. This separation of content (HTML) and presentation (CSS) allows for greater flexibility and efficiency in web design. CSS rules can be applied either inline within HTML elements, in the head section of an HTML document, or in external CSS files, enabling consistent styling across multiple pages of a website.
