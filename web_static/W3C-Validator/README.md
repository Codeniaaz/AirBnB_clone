lso known as the W3C Markup Validation Service, is a tool provided by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that allows users to check the validity of HTML, XHTML, and XML documents against web standards. It helps web developers ensure that their web pages comply with the official specifications and guidelines set by W3C.

Using the W3C Validator, developers can identify errors, inconsistencies, or deprecated features in their code that may affect the performance, accessibility, or compatibility of their websites across different browsers and devices. By fixing these issues, developers can improve the quality, reliability, and usability of their web pages, ultimately enhancing the overall user experience.

The W3C Validator provides detailed error messages and suggestions for resolving issues found in the code, helping developers understand and address any potential problems efficiently. It encourages adherence to web standards and best practices, promoting interoperability and accessibility on the World Wide Web.
